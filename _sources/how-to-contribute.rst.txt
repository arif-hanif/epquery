How to contribute
=================

1. Open a new issue describing the desired feature or the bug. If you are willing to add/fix yourself, go to point 2.

2. Add new branch or fork the project and make the required changes.

3. If adding a new feature, implement a unit test(s) for your changes. Otherwise, update the unit test(s) associated with your changes accordingly.

4. Merge the latest version from the master to your branch and run all unit tests to verify changes have not broken stable code.

5. Make a pull request from the new branch to the master, assign the issue to `@krzysztofarendt`_ for review and for merging to the master branch.
